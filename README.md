This repository contains all the code used for creating the results in my research.

The main branch and brances starting with Dino are part of preliminary testing. These all use a working version of the dino game, and are a modified version of the dino game by dhrruv: https://github.com/dhhruv/Chrome-Dino-Runner

The tests used for the main part or the research can be found in the simpleTest branch. This does not use the dino game, but instead uses a state space representation found in the csv files.
